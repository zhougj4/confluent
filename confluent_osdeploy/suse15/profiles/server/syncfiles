# It is advised to avoid /var/lib/confluent/public as a source for syncing.  /var/lib/confluent/public
# is served without authentication and thus any sensitive content would be a risk. If wanting to host
# syncfiles on a common share, it is suggested to have /var/lib/confluent be the share and use some other
# subdirectory other than public.
#
# Syncing is performed as the 'confluent' user, so all source files must be accessible by the confluent user.
#
# This file lists files to synchronize or merge to the deployed systems from the deployment server
# To specify taking /some/path/hosts on the deployment server and duplicating it to /etc/hosts:
# Note particularly the use of '->' to delineate source from target.
# /some/path/hosts -> /etc/hosts

# If wanting to simply use the same path for source and destinaiton, the -> may be skipped:
# /etc/hosts

# More function is available, for example to limit the entry to run only on n1 through n8, and to set
# owner, group, and permissions in octal notation:
# /example/source -> n1-n8:/etc/target (owner=root,group=root,permissions=600)

# Entries under APPENDONCE: will be added to specified target, only if the target does not already
# contain the data in the source already in its entirety. This allows append in a fashion that
# is friendly to being run repeatedly

# Entries under MERGE: will attempt to be intelligently merged. This supports /etc/group and /etc/passwd
# Any supporting entries in /etc/shadow or /etc/gshadow are added automatically, with password disabled
# It also will not inject 'system' ids (under 1,000 usually) as those tend to be local and rpm managed.
MERGE:
# /etc/passwd
# /etc/group

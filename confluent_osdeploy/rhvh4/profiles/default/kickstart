# /tmp/rootpw will provide a 'rootpw' line, either locking password if not configured
# or the crypted form.

# similar to timezone, confluent is asked to provide the
# deployment servers language info and replicate that
# to the deployment target.

# a node. This will become a bootloader line if a password
# was specified

# the getinstalldisk script to make a best guess as to the most
# appropriate device. See pre.sh and getinstalldisk to customize
# the automatic behavior, or comment out/delete the 
# following line and provide your own manual partition plan
# instead
